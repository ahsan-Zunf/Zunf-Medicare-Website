Complete Blood Count (CBC) Test Results Range? Here are the normal ranges of CBC test. 1.Red blood cell count a.For Males: 4.35-5.65 trillion cells/L b.For Females: 3.92-5.13 trillion cells/L 2.Hemoglobin a.For Males: 13.2-16.6 grams/dL or 132-166 grams/L b.For Females: 11.6-15 grams/dL or 116-150 grams/L 3.Hematocrit a.For Males: 38.3-48.6 percent b.For Females: 35.5-44.9 percent 4.White blood cell count For both males and females, it is 3.4-9.6 billion cells/L or 3,400 to 9,600 cells/mcL. 5.Platelet count a.For Males: 135-317 billion/L or 135,000 to 317,000/mcL b.For Females: 157-371 billion/L or 157,000 to 371,000/mcL What are the Benefits of this Test? There are multiple benefits of a CBC test some of them are as follows. You will get to know if all of your blood components are in the normal range or not. It will give you an idea if you have any deficiencies or toxicities. When you get an overview of what the problem is and where the problem lies, you will handle it easily.
